    QUERY COUNT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN OF THIS FUNCTION
    ------------------------------------------------
    The history page and the home page both draw participant avatars and a
    caption count for every row. Fetched naively that is 2N+1 queries for N
    meetings, and it gets worse as a user accumulates history — exactly the
    cost MeetingDetail's docstring warns about.

    This is four queries regardless of N:

      1. the meetings themselves
      2. `selectinload(Meeting.participants)` — one IN query for all of them
      3. `.selectinload(MeetingParticipant.user)` — one IN query for all users
      4. one grouped COUNT over transcripts

    The grouped count is the part that is easy to get wrong. One
    `len(meeting.transcripts)` per meeting would load every caption row of
    every meeting into memory just to count them, which for a day of demos is
    tens of thousands of rows to produce a handful of integers.
