"""WebSocket endpoint: hand landmarks in, recognised text out.

    WS /ws/predict/{meeting_code}?token=<jwt>

WHAT CROSSES THIS SOCKET
------------------------
Coordinates. Twenty-one (x, y, z) triples per hand — about 500 bytes a frame,
roughly 5 KB/s at our 10 FPS send rate. **No video frame ever travels this
socket**, and there is no code path here that could accept one. MediaPipe runs
in the browser, so the user's camera feed never leaves their machine.

That is the central privacy claim of BridgeTalk's architecture, and this file is
where it is either true or not. It is true.

WHY THE TOKEN IS IN THE QUERY STRING
------------------------------------
The browser WebSocket API cannot set an Authorization header — the constructor
takes a URL and nothing else. The options are a query parameter, a cookie, or a
first message containing the token. We use a query parameter, which is standard
practice, with one caveat worth knowing: query strings appear in server access
logs in a way headers do not. On a locally-hosted project that is acceptable;
in production it would argue for short-lived, single-use socket tickets.
