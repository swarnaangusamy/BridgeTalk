"""Tracks live WebSocket connections, grouped by meeting.

Two things need this: the inference socket, which broadcasts recognised text to
the *other* participant so it can appear as their subtitle, and the WebRTC
signalling socket, which relays offers and ICE candidates between peers.

State lives in process memory, which is a real constraint worth naming: running
two backend workers would put two participants in two separate registries and
they would never see each other. For a 1:1 meeting on a single Uvicorn process
that is fine, and it is what this project runs. Scaling past that means moving
this registry into Redis — noted in the README's limitations rather than
pretended away.
