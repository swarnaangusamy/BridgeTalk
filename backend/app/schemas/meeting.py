    WHY THIS CARRIES PARTICIPANTS, WHICH MeetingDetail's DOCSTRING WARNED OFF
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    MeetingDetail notes that listing history should not "drag every participant
    row along with every meeting". That concern was about the N+1 query a naive
    list would cause, and it is addressed rather than ignored: the history
    endpoint eager-loads participants with `selectinload`, which costs two
    extra queries for the whole page regardless of how many meetings it
    returns, and the caption counts come from one grouped COUNT rather than one
    per meeting. Four queries total, not 2N+1.

    The alternative was for the frontend to fetch each meeting individually to
    draw its avatars, which is the N+1 the warning was about, moved to the
    network where it costs more.
