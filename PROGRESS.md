# BridgeTalk — PROGRESS

> **Purpose.** A new session must be able to resume from this file alone.
> Status is assigned by **running the code**, not by reading the README.
> Last updated: Phase 0 audit, 2026-10-04.

## Detected stack

| Layer | Detected | Version |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | React + Vite + Tailwind | React 18, Vite 7.3.6 |
| Backend | FastAPI + Uvicorn | Python 3.11 |
| Hand tracking | `@mediapipe/tasks-vision` HandLandmarker (browser, WASM) | — |
| ML | TensorFlow / Keras | TF 2.16.2, numpy 1.26.4 |
| Speech (primary) | Web Speech API | browser |
| Speech (fallback) | faster-whisper `base`, int8, CPU | 1.0.3 / ctranslate2 4.8.1 |
| Audio decode | ffmpeg | 9.0.1 |
| Database | MySQL 8 via SQLAlchemy 2.0.36 | **Unix socket, not TCP 3306** |
| Auth | JWT (python-jose) + passlib/bcrypt | — |
| Ports | backend `:8000`, frontend `:5173` | both verified up |

Repo: 28 commits, branch `client`, remote `origin` → `github.com/swarnaangusamy/BridgeTalk.git`.
Working tree clean. **220 tests pass, 2 skipped** (`pytest backend/tests`).

> **MySQL gotcha:** `mysqladmin ping` and `lsof -iTCP:3306` both return empty
> because MySQL listens on a **Unix socket**. The SQLAlchemy connection the
> backend actually uses was tested and works. Do not read the empty `lsof` as
> "MySQL is down".

## Database schema (current)

Five tables in `database/schema.sql`, all present in the live database:

| Table | Key columns |
|---|---|
| `users` | id, name, email (unique), password_hash, role, created_at |
| `meetings` | id, code (unique), title, host_id, **is_interview_mode**, started_at, ended_at, created_at |
| `meeting_participants` | id, meeting_id, user_id, joined_at, left_at — a log, not a set |
| `transcripts` | id, meeting_id, user_id, source (`sign`/`speech`), content, confidence, created_at |
| `focus_events` | id, meeting_id, user_id, event_type (`blur`/`hidden`/`return`), created_at |

**Schema gaps for later phases:** `focus_events` has no `duration_away`
column, and there is no violation-count or removal state.

---

## Trained models on disk

| Model | File | Features | Classes | Measured accuracy | How measured |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ISL words** (dynamic, BiLSTM) — *the demo model* | `dynamic_model.keras` | `(30, 132)` | 40 + 1 internal | **85.23% top-1**, 94.63% top-3 on 149 held-out clips; **17.5% WER** continuous | `evaluate.py` + `evaluate_continuous.py` on a held-out split |
| ASL letters (static, MLP) — baseline only | `static_model.keras` | `(63,)` | 28 | **90.53% top-1**, 96.91% top-3 on 6,440 held-out samples | `evaluate.py` |
| **ISL fingerspelling** (static, MLP) | — | `(126,)` | — | **NEVER TRAINED** | no dataset was available |
| Whisper | `ml/models/whisper/` (141 MB) | — | — | not an accuracy metric; 1,061 ms for 2.8 s audio | real speech through `/ws/transcribe` |

**Note on the dynamic feature width:** the spec says 126 (2 hands × 63). Our
dynamic model uses **132** = 126 shape + 6 wrist-position values. This was a
measured improvement, not a deviation for its own sake: with 126 the wrist sits
at the origin in every frame, so a hand held still and a hand sweeping across
the body produce an identical vector. Adding position took top-1 from 79.75% to
84.81% and removed every movement-pair confusion (bad/good, big/small,
dry/wet). The **static** ISL model will use 126 exactly as specified.

## Measured accuracy — held-out splits only

| Model | Measured | Split | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ISL words (BiLSTM, `(30,132)`, 40 classes) | **85.23%** top-1, 94.63% top-3; **17.5% WER** continuous | random | INCLUDE records no signer id, so `signer_disjoint: false` |
| ISL fingerspelling (MLP, `(126,)`, 35 classes) | **92.04% macro recall** over 28 judgeable classes | **pose-disjoint** | weighted top-1 is 98.14% but inflated; 7 classes unjudgeable; H and J at 0% |
| ASL fingerspelling (MLP, `(63,)`, 28 classes) | 90.53% top-1, 96.91% top-3 | contiguous | baseline only |

Live-path latency: ASL 0.70 ms, ISL 0.71 ms, words 6.12 ms median.

---

## Decisions made, and why

- **Dataset substitution.** The brief named
  `eraakash/indian-sign-language-hand-landmarks-dataset`; it does not exist
  (0 datasets under that author, control dataset resolved fine). Three other
  ISL candidates on HF contain no data at all. Used
  `Hemg/Indian_sign_language_dataset` — 42,745 images, 35 classes. **No
  licence declared**, recorded as a caveat.
- **Pose-disjoint splitting for ISL fingerspelling.** 41,609 images collapse
  to 1,159 distinct poses (2.8%), scattered rather than adjacent, so no
  index-based split can separate copies. Without this the model reports 99.75%
  and means nothing.
- **Dynamic model keeps 132 features**, not the 126 the brief specifies.
  With 126 the wrist sits at the origin every frame, so a still hand and a
  sweeping hand are identical vectors. Position took top-1 from 79.75% to
  84.81%. The **static** ISL model uses 126 exactly as specified.
- **Vocabulary capped at 40.** Measured: 20 → 84.81%, 40 → 89.93%, 70 →
  78.99%. INCLUDE's clip counts fall off a cliff after ~48 words.
- **Inference is a compiled `tf.function`.** Masking around an LSTM forces a
  per-timestep path: 1,373 ms eager → 18 ms compiled.
- **Violation feed is polled, not pushed.** Adding a third message type to the
  inference socket would couple attention logging to sign recognition, so a
  failure in one would take the other down.
- **Tailwind advisories not fixed.** `npm audit --omit=dev` reports zero; they
  are dev-only. The only fix is a breaking Tailwind 4 migration.

## Known issues

1. **Docker stack never run.** Docker is not installed on this machine. YAML
   parses, all paths resolve, images unbuilt. The one genuinely unverified
   deliverable.
2. **No HTTPS.** Required for camera/mic/Web Speech from any device other than
   localhost. Documented, not provided.
3. **`useFocusMonitor.js` is now dead code**, superseded by
   `useInterviewMode.js`. Left in place rather than deleted; safe to remove.
4. **H and J fingerspelling at 0% recall**, and 7 letters unjudgeable — a
   property of the source data, not the training.
5. **Section 4 journey not walked in two browser windows.** Every layer below
   the browser is verified; the two-window click-through needs a human.

---

## Final verification run (end of session)

Both services restarted from cold, then the whole journey driven through the
API. Every step passed.

```

```

Not covered by this run, and needing a human in a browser: the two-window
click-through, the camera preview in the lobby, fullscreen and Keyboard Lock
actually engaging, and a real microphone producing captions. Every layer
beneath those is verified above.

## Measured recognition gates (Part A4)

Thresholds live in `frontend/src/config/recognition.js` and were chosen by
measuring, not guessing. Reproduce with `python ml/scripts/measure_gates.py`.

Gates: **confidence ≥ 0.7**, **margin over runner-up ≥ 0.15**.

### Accuracy on held-out data

| | ISL words | ISL letters |
|---|---|---|
| Held-out samples | 149 clips | 6343 |
| Rejected by the gates | 8 (5.4%) | 16 (0.2%) |
| **Accuracy of accepted** | **88.65%** | **98.37%** |
| Accuracy overall | 83.89% | 98.12% |

A rejection is a *missed* caption, not a wrong one. The two matter differently:
a miss is recoverable by signing again, a wrong caption is not.

### Idle false-positive rate — the number that matters more

Fed input containing no sign at all, how often do the gates let something
through? Target is zero.

| Input | ISL words | ISL letters |
|---|---|---|
| No hands (all zeros) | **0.0%** | **100.0%** |
| One pose held perfectly still | **56.8%** | n/a (no motion concept) |
| Random landmark noise | 52.2% | 81.8% |

**These are worst-case numbers with motion gating removed, and they are the
honest reason the motion gate exists.**

Two things the confidence and margin gates genuinely cannot do:

1. **The letter model passes all-zeros 100% of the time.** It learned that an
   empty hand slot looks like something, because ~31% of its training hand
   slots were legitimately empty — ISL has one-handed letters. In production
   this cannot fire: the backend returns the neutral state without calling the
   model when no hands are present. But it means the probability output carries
   no information about whether a hand is there.

2. **A pose held still passes 57% of the time.** A resting hand IS a valid
   handshape, so the model is not *wrong* to be confident about it, and no
   probability threshold separates "resting in this shape" from "signing this
   letter". Stability gating cannot help either — a parked hand is perfectly
   stable. This is what produced the reported "detecting M at 71% while not
   signing".

Movement is the only signal that distinguishes them, which is why
`MOTION_LOOKBACK_FRAMES` exists: nothing is committed unless real movement
occurred within the last 20 frames (2 s at 10 FPS). A hand left in frame stops
producing captions about two seconds after it stops moving.

**Not yet measured:** the end-to-end false-positive rate *with* motion gating
active, because the motion gate runs in the browser against live landmark
velocity and there is no recorded idle-webcam fixture to replay through it.
Acceptance check A6.4 — hands resting for 30 seconds — is the manual test that
covers it, and it needs a human at a camera.

## Parts A and B complete — Part C (interface rebuild) NOT started

### The seven reported problems: root cause and fix

| # | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Whisper decoded each MediaRecorder fragment independently. Only the first carries the WebM init segment, so fragments 2+ decoded to **zero samples**. The server got 250 ms of audio then silence forever; the VAD discarded it as too short. Nothing logged, because "no audio in this chunk" looks identical to "quiet chunk" | `StreamDecoder` keeps the stream and decodes it whole, feeding forward only new samples. Also: engine default is now **Auto** (browser engine first) — Whisper was defaulting in Chrome and only emits on pause |
| 2 | The socket broadcast `result.sentence` — the **accumulated** sentence — as caption text, and a 2.5 s cooldown was the only repeat guard, so a held pose re-committed every time it lapsed | One caption event carrying only that segment's text; `useSignCaptions` commits once per **movement** segment and refuses to repeat until hands return to rest |
| 3 | Same accumulated-sentence broadcast, persisted once per emitted word → rows reading "a", "a b", "a b c" | One row per `segment_id`, written on the final event, with a **UNIQUE** DB constraint so a retry collides instead of duplicating |
| 4 | `track.enabled = false` keeps the camera open; the detection loop early-returned on `!cameraOn` **without clearing `landmarks`**, so the last skeleton stayed in React state over a black tile | Camera off now **stops** the track and releases the device; `replaceTrack` keeps the peer in sync; the overlay is cleared with it |
| 5 | `signDetectionOn` defaulted to **true** for every participant | Opt-in, defaults off, and gated on the camera being on |
| 6 | The lobby put `deviceId` in the join URL — a stable hardware identifier in a link users are told to share, plus history and Referer | `sessionStorage`, which also survives the reload the URL was for, and expires with the tab |
| 7 | Recognition was gated on display toggles inside panel components | Producing is automatic (mic unmuted / camera on). The captions button controls display only. Recognition moved to meeting-level hooks |

### Status

| Part | State |
|---|---|
| A — caption pipeline | **Done**, transport verified live |
| B — screen sharing | **Done**, signalling verified live; media path needs two browsers |
| C — interface rebuild | **Done** — see below |
| D — final verification | **Automated checks done. The checks that need a camera, a voice and two participants are listed below and are yours to run.** |

---

## Part C — interface rebuild: done

### The crash that started this, and why nothing caught it

The reported error was `Cannot access 'applyAndRecord' before initialization`.
It was not one mistake, it was **eleven**. `const` bindings are hoisted but sit
in the temporal dead zone until their initialiser runs, and MeetingRoom.jsx read
eight different bindings above the line that defined them:

| Binding | Used at | Declared at |
|---|---|---|
| `applyAndRecord` | 232 | 246 |
| `addScreenTrack`, `removeScreenSender`, `sendSignal` | 351–353 | 466 |
| `remotePresenter` | 363, 365, 375 | 466 |
| `interview` | 373, 375 | 423 |
| `remoteScreenStream` | 377 | 466 |
| `toggleCamera` | 393, 401 | 516 |

A hook **dependency array** is what makes this easy to miss. The callback body
is deferred and reads fine, but `[screenShare, remotePresenter, interview]` is
evaluated during render, so it throws before anything calls the callback.

Nothing caught it because nothing was looking. `package.json` had carried a
`lint` script and four pinned ESLint packages since Phase 0 **with no config
file**, so `npm run lint` exited with "couldn't find a configuration file".
`vite build` does not help: it transforms modules and performs no scope
analysis, so the bundle built cleanly while the page was broken.

Two things now cover it:

* `frontend/.eslintrc.cjs`, with `no-use-before-define` as an **error**.
* `frontend/src/test/` — vitest + jsdom mount all eight routes and fail if
  anything throws. `setup.js` also fails a test when React logs a render error,
  so a crash swallowed by an error boundary cannot pass silently.

### What was built

| Page | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Login / Register | `pages/Login.jsx` | 400px card, floating labels, two routes one component |
| Home | `pages/Home.jsx` | New-meeting menu, code-or-link join, 5 recent meetings |
| Lobby | `pages/Lobby.jsx` | Mirrored preview, live mic level, 3 device pickers, "I will be signing" |
| Meeting room | `pages/MeetingRoom.jsx` | Stage / caption rail / control bar, 3 slide-in panels, Settings |
| Meeting ended | `pages/MeetingEnded.jsx` | Rejoin withheld once the meeting is over |
| History | `pages/History.jsx` | Server-side search over titles **and** caption text |
| Transcript | `pages/Transcript.jsx` | Chips, participant filter, highlighted search, TXT + PDF |
| Sign recognition check | `pages/SignDetection.jsx` | The extra page the spec's C8 asks to be listed |

Design system in `components/ui/` (Icon, Avatar, IconButton, Dialog, Menu,
TextField, Select, ToastHost, States, TopBar, Logo); meeting-specific pieces in
`components/meeting/` (Stage, MeetingTile, CaptionRail, ControlBar, SidePanel,
DetailsPanel, PeoplePanel, LiveTranscriptPanel, SettingsDialog).

Ten superseded files were deleted: `CaptionArea`, `MeetingHeaderControls`,
`ModeSwitch`, `SpeechControls`, `SubtitleBar`, `TranscriptPanel`,
`TranscriptDownloadButton`, `VideoTile`, `useFocusMonitor`, `useSpeechToText`,
plus `Dashboard` and `MeetingDetail` which Home and Transcript replace.

### Bugs found and fixed while building it

1. **The lobby's device picker did nothing.** Problem 6 was a raw `deviceId` in
   the join URL. The lobby was moved to `sessionStorage`, but MeetingRoom was
   never updated — it still read `searchParams.get('camera')`, which is now
   always `null`. Every meeting silently used the system default camera and
   microphone. A test now asserts the chosen ids reach `getUserMedia`.

2. **A lost canvas context destroyed the whole meeting.** `HandOverlayCanvas`
   used `canvas.getContext('2d')` without a null check. That is null in a real
   browser when the GPU context is lost — a driver reset, or a backgrounded tab
   reclaimed under memory pressure. The throw lands in React's commit phase and
   escalates to the nearest error boundary, so losing a decorative skeleton
   overlay took down the camera, the captions and the call. Guarded.

3. **`DEMO-01` became unjoinable.** `formatMeetingCode` re-grouped codes into
   the generator's `ABC-DEF` shape. The seeded demo meeting's code is four
   characters then two, so regrouping produced `DEM-O01` and joining failed with
   "meeting not found". Codes are opaque strings compared for equality;
   reformatting one is never safe.

4. **52 class names silently rendered as nothing.** Removing `ink-*`,
   `bridge-*` and `signal-*` from `tailwind.config.js` left 52 references across
   6 files. Tailwind drops classes it cannot resolve, with no error anywhere, so
   those components would have appeared completely unstyled. All remapped.

5. **The transcript search could be crashed by typing a bracket.** The
   highlighter built a `RegExp` from the raw query, so `(` threw
   "Unterminated group" and took the page down. The needle is escaped.

6. **The interview log would have shown only em dashes.** It read
   `event.duration_ms`; `FocusEventPublic` calls it `duration_away_ms`.

7. **The sign button lied for a moment.** It said "No sign recognition model is
   loaded" during the fraction of a second before the socket reported. "Not
   loaded" and "not yet known" are now distinct states.

### Two backend changes the interface needed

`GET /api/meetings/history` previously returned `MeetingPublic`, which carries
neither participants nor a caption count — both of which the Home cards and
History rows draw. The alternative was the frontend fetching each meeting
individually, which is an N+1 moved onto the network.

New `MeetingSummary` adds both. This reverses a caution in `MeetingDetail`'s own
docstring about history "dragging every participant row along", so the cost is
handled rather than ignored: `selectinload` for participants and their users,
and **one grouped COUNT** for the captions. Four queries regardless of how many
meetings. `test_history_does_not_issue_a_query_per_meeting` fails if the eager
loading is ever removed.

The endpoint also takes `?q=`, searching titles **and** caption text, because
"the meeting where we talked about the dataset" is how people actually look for
a transcript. Caption text is matched with a **subquery, not a JOIN** — a join
returns one row per matching caption, so a meeting containing the word five
times would appear five times.
`test_history_search_returns_each_meeting_once` guards exactly that.

### Automated verification — what I ran, and what it proves

```
cd frontend && npm run lint      0 errors, 6 warnings
cd frontend && npm test          13 passed
cd frontend && npx vite build    built in 2.6s
pytest backend/tests -q          258 passed, 2 skipped
```

The 6 remaining lint warnings are 5 × `react-refresh/only-export-components`
(files that deliberately export a hook beside a component) and 1 pre-existing
`exhaustive-deps` in `SignDetection.jsx`. None affects correctness.

Live, against the running backend on MySQL:

```
GET  /health                     all three models loaded, MySQL connected,
                                 Whisper base ready
POST /api/auth/login/json        200
GET  /api/meetings/history       200, 32 meetings, caption_count and
                                 participants present on every row
GET  /api/meetings/history?q=…   200, filters correctly
GET  /api/meetings/DEMO-01       200 — confirms fix 3 above
```

Model status as actually reported by `/health`:

| Model | Loaded | Classes | val_accuracy |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASL letters (`static`) | yes | 28 | 0.9404 |
| ISL letters (`isl`) | yes | 35 | 0.9919 |
| ISL words (`dynamic`) | yes | 40 | 0.8571 |

**These are validation figures, not test figures.** The validation split is what
early stopping and threshold choices were made against, so it is optimistic by
construction. The honest held-out numbers are the ones already recorded earlier
in this file: **90.5%** test accuracy for Model A, and **92.04% macro recall**
for the ISL letters model under pose-disjoint splitting, with 7 unjudgeable
classes and H and J at 0%. The Settings dialog labels its number "validation
accuracy" for this reason, and prints "No accuracy recorded" rather than leaving
a blank where there is no figure.

---

## Part D — what still needs a human

Everything below needs a camera, a voice, or two participants, so none of it can
be verified from a terminal. **I have not seen any of it work.**

Start both servers, then open **two different browser profiles** (not two tabs —
each needs its own camera permission and its own login):

```bash
./scripts/run_backend.sh      # :8000
./scripts/run_frontend.sh     # :5173
```

Sign in as a different account in each. Add `?debug=1` to the meeting URL to get
the diagnostic overlay.

### D1 — the outcome that matters most

| # | Do this | Expect |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Hearing user says a full sentence | Grey interim text appears on **both** screens within ~1s, and turns **white** when they pause |
| 2 | Deaf user signs a word | The word appears on **both** screens, once |
| 3 | Open the Transcript panel | Exactly one entry per utterance. No entry contains an earlier entry's text |
| 4 | Rest hands in frame, 30 seconds | **Zero** captions appear |
| 5 | Hold one sign for 5 seconds | It appears **once**, not repeatedly |
| 6 | Mute, speak, unmute, speak | Captions stop, then resume with no further click |
| 7 | One user presses CC off | The other still receives everything; the transcript stays complete |

If 1 or 2 fails, read the `?debug=1` overlay and tell me which line is wrong —
mic track state, engine, last caption sent, last caption received. That
distinguishes "not recognised" from "recognised but not delivered", which have
completely different causes.

### D2 — screen sharing

| # | Do this | Expect |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Press Present, choose a window | Screen fills the stage; **both camera tiles stay visible** in the right-hand strip |
| 2 | Watch from the other browser | The same screen appears, letterboxed, never cropped |
| 3 | Press Stop presenting | Layout returns to normal for both |
| 4 | Present again, then use the **browser's own** "Stop sharing" bar | Layout returns to normal for both |
| 5 | Press Present, then cancel the picker | Nothing happens, and **no error appears** |
| 6 | While A presents, B presses Present | B is asked "Take over presenting?" |
| 7 | Sign while presenting | Captions keep working, read from the camera and not the screen |

### D3 — every page, at desktop width and below 900px

Login → Register → Home → lobby → meeting → leave → meeting-ended →
transcript → History → transcript → `/detect`. In the meeting, open each of
the three right-hand panels (the stage should shrink, only one open at a time),
open Settings and walk all three tabs, and try `Ctrl/Cmd+D`, `Ctrl/Cmd+E` and
`C`.

### D4 — interview mode

Host turns it on from the More menu. The other participant should get the
acknowledgement dialog, an "Interview mode" chip at the top-left of the stage,
and a blocking overlay if they switch tab. Opening the screen picker must **not**
be recorded as a violation. Afterwards, the host opens the transcript and
expands "Interview mode log".

### Known limitations, stated plainly

* **Untrained-model honesty.** All three models load here, but only Model A has
  a held-out test figure measured under a disjoint split. No claim is made for
  the others beyond what `/health` reports.
* **Continuous signing.** A signer who moves from one sign to the next without
  pausing is still the hard case; measured word error rate was 17.5% on a
  continuous stream built from held-out clips, and 34.2% with pauses.
* **Idle false positives.** The ISL letters model fires on empty landmark slots
  (measured 100% on zero-input frames), because ~31% of its training slots were
  legitimately empty. `MOTION_LOOKBACK_FRAMES` exists to gate that, and D1
  check 4 is the test that it works in practice.
* **Speaker selection.** `setSinkId` is Chromium-only, so the speaker dropdown
  is hidden in Firefox and Safari rather than shown doing nothing.
* **Preferences do not follow you to another computer.** Caption size, engine
  and recognition mode live in `localStorage` per user id, not on the server.
* **Icons need the network on first load.** Material Symbols comes from Google
  Fonts, with `display=block` so the control bar never shows the literal
  ligature names. Offline on a cold cache, the icons are blank; every button
  still has its tooltip and accessible label.

## Technical documentation — complete

`docs/BridgeTalk_Project_Documentation.md` — 21 sections plus a verification
appendix, 5,538 lines, 10 Mermaid diagrams, 174 tables.

A **read-only** exercise over the application code: `git diff` confirms nothing
outside `docs/` and this file changed. Facts come from the source, the live MySQL
schema, the saved model artefacts, and commands run while writing.

### Completeness, audited programmatically against the code

| Item | In code | In document |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP route entries | 22 (18 ours + 4 FastAPI) | 22 |
| WebSocket endpoints | 3 | 3 |
| Route handler functions | 21 | 21 |
| Pydantic schemas | 20 ours (+3 generated) | 20 |
| Database tables | 5 | 5 |
| Database columns | 34 | 34 |
| Frontend routes | 10 `<Route>` (9 pages) | 10 |
| Page components | 8 | 8 |
| Custom hooks | 12 | 12 |
| Backend test files | 15 | 15 |
| Environment variables | all from `.env.example` | all |
| WebSocket message types | 11 / 13 / 6 per socket | 11 / 13 / 6 |

A script checked every one of these appears by name in the document. It found
three gaps (the WebSocket handler names) which were then added. Final run: no
gaps. 43 internal links all resolve.

### Defects found while documenting — recorded, not fixed

| ID | Severity | Issue |
|---|---|---|
| **K-1** | **Critical** | **Settings → Captions → "Browser (Web Speech)" crashes the meeting room, and the crash survives a reload.** The dialog stores `speechEngine: 'browser'`, but the registry in `services/stt/index.js` is keyed `webspeech`. `resolveProvider('browser')` reaches its fallback branch and dereferences `PROVIDERS['browser'].label` on `undefined`, throwing `TypeError`. It is called in the body of `useSpeechCaptions`, so it throws during render. The preference persists in `localStorage`. **Confirmed by running the real module under Vitest.** Workaround: keep the engine on "Auto" or "Whisper" |
| **K-2** | Major | `POST /api/transcripts` accepts `segment_id` and silently discards it, so rows created that way are not protected by `UNIQUE (meeting_id, segment_id)`. No frontend page calls this endpoint. **Confirmed against the live API** |
| **K-3** | Major | `GET /api/meetings/{code}/focus-events` omits `duration_away_ms` from every event, so the host's interview log shows an em dash for every duration. The `by_participant` aggregates are correct. **Confirmed against the live API and the database** |
| **K-4** | Minor | Model C has 0.0000 recall on ISL letters `H` and `J` |

Plus discrepancies K-5 to K-10 (notably: the ISL letters dataset's name, source
and licence are **not recorded anywhere**, and `isl_dataset_manifest.json`
carries the ASL dataset's details) and operational limits K-11 to K-20.

### Verification side effects

Exercising the live API created rows in the development database, left in place
rather than deleted: `meetings` id 139 (`4T9-7M2`), `meeting_participants`
id 157, `focus_events` ids 25–26, `transcripts` id 51. That meeting also has
Interview Mode switched on.
