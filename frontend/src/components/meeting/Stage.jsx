/**
 * The video area.
 *
 * THREE LAYOUTS, CHOSEN BY HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE HERE
 * ------------------------------------------------
 *   alone      your own tile fills the stage
 *   two        the other person fills the stage, your video is a small
 *              floating tile at the bottom-right
 *   three+     an even grid
 *
 * The two-person case is the one that matters for this product, and "the other
 * person fills the stage" is not a cosmetic choice: when they are signing, the
 * hearing user needs their hands as large as possible. A symmetric
 * side-by-side split would halve the signer for no benefit.
 *
 * PRESENTING OVERRIDES ALL THREE
 * ------------------------------
 * While anyone presents, the shared screen fills the stage and the camera tiles
 * become a vertical strip on the right. The strip is kept — rather than hiding
 * the cameras to give the screen more room — precisely because the signer must
 * stay visible while someone presents. A shared screen with no signer on it is
 * a broken call for a deaf participant.
 *
 * The screen uses `object-contain`, never `object-cover`: cropping a shared
 * screen cuts off whatever is at its edges, which is usually the thing being
 * pointed at.
