/**
 * Settings the user changes in the meeting, remembered per user.
 *
 * WHY PER USER, AND WHY localStorage RATHER THAN sessionStorage
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * The specification says "preferences are remembered per user". These are
 * durable choices about how the product behaves — caption size, which
 * recognition model, which speech engine — not per-meeting choices, so unlike
 * device selection (sessionStorage, deliberately, see devicePreferences.js)
 * they should survive closing the tab.
 *
 * The key is namespaced by user id so two people sharing a laptop, which is
 * exactly what happens when this is demonstrated, do not inherit each other's
 * caption size. A null id falls back to a shared key rather than throwing,
 * because preferences must not be what breaks a page.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT ON THE SERVER
 * ---------------------------
 * It could be, and a `user_preferences` table would survive a change of
 * machine. It is not, because every one of these settings is about THIS
 * browser's rendering and THIS browser's engine support — a Whisper preference
 * means nothing on a device whose browser has Web Speech — and because adding a
 * table and two endpoints to remember a font size is not a trade worth making
 * here. The cost is honest and small: preferences do not follow you to another
 * computer.
 *
 * Every access is wrapped. localStorage throws in a private window with site
 * data blocked, and a remembered caption size must never stop a meeting
 * loading.
