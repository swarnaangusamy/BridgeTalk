/**
 * The live caption list, keyed by segment id.
 *
 * THE RULE THAT MATTERS
 * ---------------------
 * An interim event carries the FULL CURRENT text of its segment, so a receiver
 * **replaces** the entry with that id. It never appends.
 *
 * Appending is what produced the reported
 * "warm warm fast we we we we old warm warm warm": every interim was treated
 * as new text and concatenated onto the line before it.
 *
 * A final event closes the segment. The entry stays in the list — it is now
 * settled text — and the producer moves to a new id.
 *
 * WHY THE LIST IS CAPPED
 * ----------------------
 * The caption area shows the most recent few lines. An hour-long meeting would
 * otherwise hold thousands of entries in React state and re-render all of them
 * on every interim, which arrive several times a second. The transcript panel
 * reads from the database, not from here, so nothing is lost by trimming.
