/**
 * Interview Mode enforcement: fullscreen, keyboard lock, and escape detection.
 *
 * BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT A WEB PAGE CAN DO
 * --------------------------------------
 * A web page **cannot** prevent tab switching. There is no API for it, by
 * design — a page that could trap you in itself would be a weapon. So this
 * builds the strongest layered version the browser actually permits, and the
 * UI claims exactly that and no more:
 *
 *   1. Fullscreen on acknowledgement. Leaving fullscreen is then itself a
 *      detectable event, which it is not for an ordinary tab.
 *   2. Keyboard Lock (`navigator.keyboard.lock`) where supported — Chromium
 *      only, and only while fullscreen. This routes Ctrl+T, Ctrl+N, Ctrl+Tab
 *      and Esc to the page instead of the browser. It does NOT capture
 *      Alt+Tab or Cmd+Tab: those belong to the operating system and no web
 *      API reaches them.
 *   3. Detection via `visibilitychange`, window `blur` and
 *      `fullscreenchange` — three signals because each misses cases the
 *      others catch.
 *   4. A blocking overlay until the participant returns AND is back in
 *      fullscreen, so the escape costs them the meeting view.
 *
 * What it still cannot see: a second monitor, a phone, paper notes, or another
 * person in the room. It is a deterrent, and the dialog says so.
 *
 * WHY THE DURATION IS TRACKED HERE
 * --------------------------------
 * Only the client witnesses the departure, so only the client can time it. The
 * server cannot measure an absence it was never told about. The duration is
 * sent with the `return` event.
