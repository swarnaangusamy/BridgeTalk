/**
 * The meeting room.
 *
 * FOUR THINGS RUN AT ONCE HERE, AND THEY SHARE ONE CAMERA
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 *   1. MediaPipe reads the local video element for hand landmarks (local only)
 *   2. those landmarks stream to /ws/predict and come back as text
 *   3. the same MediaStream is published to the peer over WebRTC
 *   4. the speech engine captions the microphone for the other direction
 *
 * getUserMedia is called exactly once and the resulting stream is shared.
 * Calling it twice would ask for the camera twice and, on some machines, fail
 * outright because the device is already open.
 *
 * PRODUCING CAPTIONS IS SEPARATE FROM DISPLAYING THEM
 * --------------------------------------------------
 * Producing is automatic: an unmuted microphone produces speech captions, and
 * sign recognition switched on with a live camera produces sign captions.
 * Neither depends on any display setting, and neither depends on a panel
 * component being mounted — which is why all of it lives in meeting-level hooks.
 *
 * The captions button controls DISPLAY only. Nobody's speech should go
 * unrecognised because they chose not to look at captions themselves.

   *     drawing over the black tile forever. That is exactly the reported

   *
