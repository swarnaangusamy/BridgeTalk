 * Speech recognition via the browser-native Web Speech API.

 * the spec, and none of it was rewritten during the move.
 *
 * THE HONEST PRIVACY NOTE
 * -----------------------
 * In Chrome this is NOT local. Audio goes to Google's servers for recognition.
 * For an accessibility tool carrying private conversation that is a real cost,
 * and it sits oddly beside BridgeTalk's "video never leaves your machine"
 * claim on the sign side. It is documented rather than glossed over, and the
 * Whisper provider is the answer for anyone who cannot accept it.
